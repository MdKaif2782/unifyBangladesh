        From a Small Shelf to a Nation’s Trust
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        It all started with a single product — a small bottle of serum bought from abroad by our founder for a family member with sensitive skin. The result was magical, but what followed in the local market was frustrating: endless fakes, high prices, and empty promises. That’s when the idea struck — what if we could create a brand that truly stands for trust, authenticity, and affordability?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Unify Bangladesh was born in 2024 not just as a business, but as a mission — to bring 100% authentic beauty and skincare products from around the world directly to Bangladeshi consumers.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        We started with just a few products from Canada and Korea, hand-packed and personally delivered to our early customers. Their smiles, reviews, and loyalty inspired us to grow — not just in size, but in responsibility. We expanded to include premium brands from the USA, UK, Thailand, and India, always putting quality before quantity.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed font-semibold text-justify">
        As our shelves filled and our customer base grew, so did our values:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-orange-700 mb-6 space-y-1 text-justify">
        <li>Honesty over hype</li>
        <li>People over profit</li>
        <li>Trust over trends</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        We’re proud to say Unify Bangladesh is now a trusted name in the beauty community, especially among women seeking safe, real, and effective skincare. With a dedicated team of professionals — from finance and marketing to operations and logistics — we ensure every product is carefully sourced, verified, and delivered with care.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed font-semibold italic text-justify">
        But our story doesn’t end here.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        We dream of a future where no woman (or man) has to wonder, “Is this real?” when buying skincare.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify">
        A future where Bangladesh becomes a hub for authentic global beauty products — and Unify leads that revolution.
      </p>

      <p className="text-orange-800 font-bold text-xl mt-8 text-justify">
        Unify Bangladesh — Believe in Better.
